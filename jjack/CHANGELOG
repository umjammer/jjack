Version 0.2.X - Release date 2007-??-??
-----------------------------------------------------

- Relative basedir in build.xml
- Use JAVA_HOME environment variable for ant build java dependencies. Example from shell: JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun ant all
- All files created during the make process are now in .cvsignore
- INF pointer type is now 64-bit (long) for AMD64 support
- fix: auto-connecting output ports now works
- added utility clients JJackPlayer and JJackRecorder in new package de.gulden.framework.jjack.util
- added benchmark tool in de.gulden.framework.jjack.util.benchmark
- (PJS) ability to load native library from local lib folder (failover if libjjack.so not present in system library path)
- (PJS) Now can be launched as an Eclipse project
- (PJS) Added JJackQuickClientLaunch which lets you select the client to launch from a dropdown
- (PJS) New experimental JavaSound mixerprovider, for plugging javasound applications directly to jack (see com.petersalomonsen.jjack.javasound.JJackMixerProviderTest)
- (PJS) libjjack.c - fixed so that allocation of objects are done once and not for every process() call
- (PJS) Javasound mixerprovider support for inputs (TargetDataLines)
- (PJS) Eclipse compiler compliance level set to 1.4
- (PJS) ByteIntConverter for supporting various audioformats
- (PJS) Lines supports 8/16/24/32 bit big and little endian audio formats
- (PJS) Fixed Mixer and line support indication logic to comply with javasound
- (PJS) longFrame, microsecond, and frameposition implemented
- (PJS) DataLine.Info now outputs audioformat info, Mixer.Info, buffersize etc.
- (AC)		- The size of the sample is found using size() rather than being hardcoded as 4
			- Some ints are cast to jsize which is long on 64 bit systems (see
			  ftp://www6.software.ibm.com/software/developer/jdk/64bitporting/64BitJavaPortingGuide.pdf)
			- The allocation of inf->byteBufferArray[mode] is made outside the loop
			  over ports.  This avoids a null pointer exception in Java when there are
			  zero ports (eg for output on a "consumer only" process).
